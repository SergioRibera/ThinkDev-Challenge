# ThinkDev Challenge
This challenge is provided by a software development company with the intention that developers can overcome the impostor syndrome and really know what our potential is, the challenge consists of 3 stages (levels) in which tests are provided based on our occupation.

## My motivation
The fact of being able to challenge myself doing something different is very much my style, so as soon as I knew that there was a challenge in which I could participate and also share the development and my performance in this, I did not hesitate to participate, this can also help me personally to see if I am really able to overcome the challenges.

## My Levels
- Level 1
  - Frontend: React, style (css)
  - Backend: Express, routes, queries, fetch data and tests
  - Blockchain: Web3, consume contract, fetch contract information
- Level 2
  > ğŸ”’ Locked
- Level 3
  > ğŸ”’ Locked
